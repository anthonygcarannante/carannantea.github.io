<!-- 
Student Bio Page
Instructions
On your own, create a simple bio page for yourself using the following HTML elements...
A header that will store your name inside of it
An image that will act as a stand-in for your picture with an alt attribute which gives a very basic description of the image
Two paragraphs that will have text describing who you are
An unordered list of links that connect to your social media pages
A table that will contain three columns and some data on your favorite movies, songs, books, or activities
Hints
Dummy images can be found at lorempixel.com and dummy text can be found at lipsum.com. Focus on getting the entire page working before diving into more specific text and images.
Bonus
Look into how one might go about linking one custom-made HTML page to another. Once you have found out how, try creating a link from your bio page you have just created to one of the pages you created last class. -->
